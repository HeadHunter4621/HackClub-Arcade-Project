# Brainstorming
## Supplies (I won't use all of them (probably)):
* Anki Vector
* Small Arduino Display
* Raspberry Pi (3B)
* Wardriving Data
* Robotics Scouting App
* 3D Printer
* Powerful(-ish) Gaming Computer
* DJI Mini 2
* Arduino Uno
* Arduino Temp & Humidity Sensor
* Messed up laptop that can be used as a server
## Project Ideas
* Raspberry Pi & Display: Run LLM on Pi to slowly generate inspirational messages to show on display?
	* Simple (too simple?)
	* Don't need to buy supplies
	* Issue: it'll definitely be too simple
* Use Pi to run some sort of AI to control vector
	* APIs available for Vector (I'm pretty sure)
	* I don't know how to code an AI
		* I can learn (probably)
* Use Pi with temp & humidity sensor to run IoT server, use Arduino and little display to show data?
	* The PI part would be fun (if Arduino Cloud supports Raspberry Pi)
	* Getting data from some random computer (another Pi maybe? I'd have to buy one) to Arduino would be difficult
