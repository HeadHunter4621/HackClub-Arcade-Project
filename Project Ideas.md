# Brainstorming
## Supplies (I won't use all of them)
* Anki Vector
* Small Arduino Display
* Raspberry Pi (3B)
* WarDriving Data
* Robotics Scouting App
* 3D Printer
* Powerful(-ish) Gaming Computer
* DJI Mini 2
* Arduino Uno
* Arduino Temp & Humidity Sensor
* "Laptop" that can be Used as a Server
* Stepper Motors from Old 3D Printer
## Project Ideas
* Raspberry Pi & Display: Run LLM on Pi to slowly generate inspirational messages (or something) to show on display?
	* Simple (too simple)
	* Don't need to buy supplies
	* Issue: it'll definitely be too simple
* Use Pi to run some sort of AI to control vector
	* APIs available for Vector (I'm pretty sure)
	* I don't know how to code an AI
		* I can learn (probably)
* Use Pi with temp & humidity sensor to run IoT server, use Arduino and little display to show data?
	* The PI part would be fun (if Arduino Cloud supports Raspberry Pi)
	* Getting data from some random computer (another Pi maybe? I'd have to buy one) to Arduino would be difficult
* ArduPilot Autonomous Plane
  * Very cool (I've wanted to do it for a very long time)
  * Very expensive
    * Flight controller alone costs >$150
* Frontend (and backend?) update for robot scouter
	* I have tried before and couldn't get rid of errors
    * I don't know how to do Android code (not well at least)
* âœ¨Use Anki Vector to make custom software (use SDK instead of WirePod)
